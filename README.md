## What These Write-Ups Represent
These are not advanced engineering walkthroughs yet.  
They are:

- My personal understanding of foundational concepts  
- Early reflections that will guide future cloud and security engineering work  
- Notes that show my progression as I build toward real-world security skills  
- A starting point for documenting everything I learn — **brick by brick**

## What Comes Next
As I move further into security engineering, this repo will eventually connect to:

- Cloud security labs (AWS IAM, networking, encryption, monitoring)  
- Hands-on TryHackMe and HackTheBox rooms  
- Python and Bash automation scripts  
- Detection engineering projects  
- Infrastructure-as-Code examples (Terraform, CloudFormation)  
- Full security engineering projects and write-ups  

This repository represents the foundation I’m building before creating more advanced, practical repos.

**Brick by brick — progressing toward Security Engineering and cloud security mastery.**
